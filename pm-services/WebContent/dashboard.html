                <p> Centrifugal pumps are a sub-class of dynamic axisymmetric work-absorbing turbomachinery. Centrifugal pumps
                    are used to transport fluids by the conversion of rotational kinetic energy to the hydrodynamic energy
                    of the fluid flow. The rotational energy typically comes from an engine or electric motor. The fluid
                    enters the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated by the impeller, flowing
                    radially outward into a diffuser or volute chamber (casing), from where it exits.</p>
                <p>
                    Common uses include water, sewage, petroleum and petrochemical pumping; a centrifugal fan is commonly used to implement a
                    vacuum cleaner. The reverse function of the centrifugal pump is a water turbine converting potential
                    energy of water pressure into mechanical rotational energy.</p>
